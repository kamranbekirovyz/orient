* Change in/out animation duration from `DurationTokens.slow` to `DurationTokens.normal`. Now better.

## 0.2.6

* Added new `CardBox` widget. It's what we know from Material as `Card`. Distinctively, it has two modes: bordered and filled (default). Filled looks pretty cool.

## 0.2.2

* Added new `Toggle` widget, which comes with haptic feedback, thumb-stretch animation and etc.
* We are going to need an accent color for toggle, radio, checkbox and etc. widgets. So, added `accent` and `accentForeground` color tokens to `Styling`
* Also, I couldn't held myself from making `NavBar`'s both mobile and web/desktop labels to have 1 max lines.

## 0.2.1
